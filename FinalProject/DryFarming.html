            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Water availability is already an issue for growers globally and is predicted to become even more so with population increase and rising temperatures from climate change. In some agricultural areas, groundwater aquifers are in steady decline, with no plans on how to reverse these trends. Additionally, under current law, there are few incentives to implement more efficient water use strategies. Born out of the Dry Farming Collaborative, The Dry Farming Institute was established in September 2019.</p>

           <p> The Dry Farming Collaborative is a group of growers, extension educators, plant breeders, and agricultural professionals partnering to increase knowledge and awareness of dry farming management practices with a hands-on participatory approach. While this group started in Western Oregon it is gaining national and international interest. The innovative, co-creative dynamic of this group has inspired a movement engaging growers and communities in collectively adapting to less water. The desire to build upon and expand this work brought together the founding board members and is the mission of The Dry Farming Institute.</p>
